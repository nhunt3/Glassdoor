String-to-Long Conversion

Given a String of digits (with a possible negative sign) such as "123", write a routine long stringToLong( String s ) that converts the string to a long, without using the built-in Java functions that would do this. The code should handle reasonable edge and error conditions gracefully. (You can rely on the input being in base-10 representation.)

Implement the class (or classes) required for a ternary tree, including insert and delete methods. A tri-nary tree is much like a binary
tree but with three child nodes for each parent instead of two -- with the left node
being values less than the parent, the right node values greater than the parent, and
the middle nodes values equal to the parent.

The trinary tree is really just a binary tree that does not merge equality with the less than or greater than side of tree.

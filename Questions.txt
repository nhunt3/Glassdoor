Take home problems:
1. Given a string, write a routine that converts the string to a long, without using the
built in functions that would do this. Describe what (if any) limitations the code has.  

2. Implement insert and delete in a tri-nary tree. A tri-nary tree is much like a binary
tree but with three child nodes for each parent instead of two -- with the left node
being values less than the parent, the right node values greater than the parent, and
the middle nodes values equal to the parent.
